The board game of Trivial Pursuit is a fun, challenging group activity that tests players' knowledge of various different topics, or 'pursuits'. We use it here to make it a little more fun to quiz yourself on MERN web development.  

The board game is shaped like a wagon wheel with spokes, and players can move in any direction to achieve their goals. Each player must 'roll' and then answer a multiple-choice question within the allotted time frame. 

The goal is to correctly answer a question on each one of the pie pieces, representing each of the categories. For each correct answer while your game piece is on a pie place, you receive that color/category's pie piece. (Only once, however!) 

The game is over when one player completes their pie with every available category.

The proposed categories are as follows:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- ECMAScript 2015 / JavaScript
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Professional Development
